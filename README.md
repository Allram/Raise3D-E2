# Raise3D-E2
Profile for Raise3D E2 printer for use in PrusaSlicer 2.3.0-Beta3 and newer.



## Importing the profile
For importing the profile, download Raise3D - E2.ini file in the main folder.
Start Prusaslicer -> File -> Import -> Import Config Bundle...

Then you are set :)



## Manually importing the config files
If you want to manually import the config files, download the whole repository
Move the folders in "Config files" folder to (on windows) C:\Users\%username%\Appdata\Roaming\Prusaslicer-Beta\

Then the profiles should be available when you start Prusaslicer


## Using Overlay
If you want to use the Overlay.svg to get a better "view" of the Printbed, you can do so this way:

Prusaslicer -> Printer Settings -> General -> Size and coordinates -> Bed shape -> Texture -> Add the Overlay.svg there
You will need to do this for all the Printer profiles.
