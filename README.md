# Raise3D-E2
Profile for Raise3D E2 printer for use in PrusaSlicer


#Using Overlay#
If you want to use the Overlay.svg to get a better "view" of the Printbed, you can do so this way:

Prusaslicer -> Printer Settings -> General -> Size and coordinates -> Bed shape -> Texture -> Add the Overlay.svg there
You will need to do this for all the Printer profiles.
